## Getting Started with server and webpack ##

Clone down the repo then install the node modules in your terminal:

<strong>npm install</strong>


and install webpack gloabally:

<strong>npm install -g webpack</strong>


Then you need to set up the node server. The server.js file can be found in the server directory:

<strong>node server.js</strong>


It is suggested that you install nodemon and run the server through this package:

<strong>nodemon server.js</strong>

After the server is set up, on a new tab in the terminal run webpack (include the -w tag to have webpack monitor any saves to the program)


<strong>webpack -w</strong>


Now the app should be running on localhost. The default port is 3000.
